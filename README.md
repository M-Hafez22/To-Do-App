## Inspiration

I inspired this project form the [**Dan Abramov**](https://egghead.io/courses/getting-started-with-redux) Redux course in egghead.io.

This project improves my knowledge about Redux by facing real-life problems and let me dive into the mindset of redux and how to think about states.
